### Shortcoming
- Microphone does not pick up wakewords in a loud environment
- Goes crazy when there is more than one person detected on tracker
- Bad build quality
- Not a fully embedded machine
- Does not have an actual monetizable use case (aside from being able to track and talk)

### Update Log
- developed an app (unfinished)
- pairs with a smart light as demo to test home automation
- fully embedded on a Raspberry Pi 4B
- is 3D printed (PETG+)
- camera is now inside the eyeball itself
- camera acceleration (using quadratics)

### Future Plans
- Allow users to register as "Friendly Members", whereby any motion detection on the "unregistereds" will send off an intruder alert to the app
- Add status box for paired smart products (Time elapsed, Power Consumption)
- Use only one powersupply
- Resolve the servo power issue
- Get better speaker
