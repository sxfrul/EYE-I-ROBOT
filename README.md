# EYE-I-ROBOT
User-tracking robotic eyes hooked up with ChatGPT (as brainpower) to serve as generic personal assistant robot


## Achievement:
- Won 3rd place in UITM's Arduino Showcase 2023

## Shortcoming:
- Microphone does not pick up wakewords in a loud environment
- Goes crazy when there is more than one person detected on tracker
- Bad build quality
- Not a fully embedded machine
- Does not have an actual monetizable use case (aside from being able to track and talk)
