> ### Shortcomings
> - Microphone does not pick up wakewords in a loud environment
> - Goes crazy when there is more than one person detected on tracker
> - Bad build quality
> - Not a fully embedded machine
> - Does not have an actual monetizable use case (aside from being able to track and talk)

> - pairs with a smart light as demo to test home automation
> - fully embedded on a **Raspberry Pi 4B**
> - is 3D printed **(PETG+)**
> - camera is now inside the eyeball itself
> - camera acceleration (using quadratics)

> ### Future Plans
> - Allow users to register as "Friendly Members", whereby any motion detection on the "unregistereds" will send off an intruder alert to the app
> - Add status box for paired smart products (Time elapsed, Power Consumption)
> - Use only one powersupply
> - Resolve the servo power issue
> - Get better speaker
